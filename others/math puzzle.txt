You have 8 balls. One of the balls is slightly heavier than the others,
but the difference in weight is not enough that you can tell using your hands. 
You have a set of scales (the kind of scales that has two sides, and you can put things on each side). 

What is the minimum way of determine the ball that weighs less?   


   2     3     4     5


weigh twice.

1. split the balls in three groups:3+3+2. Weigh/compare the groups containig three balls. 
If the scales are even : then split and wheight the third group, containing two balls to 
determine which ball is havier.


2. if one group of three shows that it is havier then the other 3-ball group, then eliminate 
the light 3-ball group and the 2-ball group. Take 2 balls from the heavier 3-ball group, place 
them on the scale to determine which one is havier, if even, then the 3rd ball is the one, 
we are looking for, if not--then - again -you have the heviest ball.

So, the answer is: weigh two times in total.
